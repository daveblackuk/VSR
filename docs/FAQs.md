# FAQs

### Why did you develop this?

VSR came about from my own needs, I wanted to fly in VR and use VATSIM, it wasn't easy to get the controller info in the cockpiut.

I also had issues remembering the frequencies, a common issue with single pilot IFR flying in any aircraft. So having a simple click to change facility eased that burden.



### Why do I need to run a server?

The server has the following benefits:

* Reduces the work load on the toolbar app in the sim; thus removing the risk of performance issues such as stuttering.
* Acts as a bridge between the toolbsar app and vPilot DLL
* Removes the need to run this in the cloud, thus incurring costs. We want to keep this as freeware

### Can we have bigger fonts in VR?

The app can be resized and positioned nearer or further from you using the following instructions:

### Can you add [insert feature] ?

VSR is designed to facilitate VATSIM flying; a key design principle is not to replicate features found in other software, for instance scribble notepads, navigraph charts integration etc. 

However, always ask over on the Discord. Some great features have come from user suggestions.

I also get usability research from watching Youtube streamers using VSR.
