# VSR VATSIM Radio

MSFS 2020 toolbar app for VATSIM

## Description

VATSIM Radio (VSR) is a toolbar app for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 that allows you to check what ATC controllers are online when flying on the VATSIM Network. You can easily change to a frequency with a single click, or place a frequency on standby ready to change when requested to by ATC. 

## Getting Started


Download the zip file and unzip into either your community folder or your preferred choice (if using an add-on linker for instance).  The server directory needs create, write and delete rights to the directory to create itâ€™s working files.

Once you are happy that everything is installed, then launch MSFS and click on the VSR.EXE file in the SERVER directory.

Server will wait for MSFS to start.  

Once the flight is started look for the headset icon in the toolbar, the app should load and get updated with your current position.

To test the app, click on the Unicom frequency 122.800 and your Comm1 radio should change to this frequency.
