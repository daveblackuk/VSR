## Description

VATSIM Radio (VSR) is a toolbar app for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 that allows you to check which ATC controllers are online when flying on the VATSIM Network. You can easily change to a frequency with a single click, or place a frequency on standby ready to change when requested to by ATC. The app also send & receives messages to and from the VATSIM network.

This app is not associated or endorsed by the VATSIM Network

## Getting Started

*** Please note ***

The install process is now via an installer programme, this will:

* Install latest release of the server
* Install latest release of the VSR Toolbar app

The installation tutorial contains important information  </a>

You can check in the simulator to ensure the toolbar app is installed and loaded:

### Running the server

Server will wait for MSFS to start.  

Once the flight is started click on the headset icon in the toolbar,

The app should load and get updated with your current position.

To test the app, click on the Unicom frequency 122.800 and your Comm1 radio should change to this frequency.  

## Virus warnings

Some AV solutions have issues with the installer; ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4178804/209872578-79477307-869d-4743-8cb9-7182a85ac571.png)

If this occurs, run the installer as administrator and allow the execution 

## vPilot integration - Important requirement for messages from Vatsim network

The installer should install in the default directory - these instructions are for manual installation:

The server integrates with vPilot using a plug-in DLL - this needs to be copied to the vPilot\plugins\ folder, if vPilot has been installed without changes then this can be found under  

C:\Users\[your username]\AppData\Local\vPilot\Plugins. 

There is a batch file (install_message.bat) in the server directory that will automatically copy the DLL to the correct directory. 

Stop and start vPilot, the reconnect to the network. 

If the DLL is correctly installed then the vPilot started message will appear in the message panel in the app; the further message will appear once vPilot is connected to the VATSIM network.

If the messages do not appear then check that correct permissions are set for for the DLL (see below under Known issues)


### Dependencies

* Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020
* Windows 10 and above
* [vPilot](https://vpilot.rosscarlson.dev/) to connect to VATSIM and relay messages 
* Newtonsoft.json.dll (for messaging) - installed with vPilot
* SimConnect

### Installing

* Download and run latest installer


### Executing program

* Run the VSR.EXE in the vs-radio-toolbar\server directory to start the app
* Start MSFS 2020, start a flight, click on VSR headset icon in the toolbat to launch the app
* A splash screen will load, if the server is correctly installed and running it will be displayed


## Known issues

* AFTER CTD restart the VSR server. This can be done from U/I using debug menu in left hand header above Airports table. Failure to restart might cause the App from updating frequencies and getting postion updates from Sim. 

* Crash to desktop issues have been reported with the Fenix A320; changing the memory allocations as per <a href="https://kb.fenixsim.com/potential-way-to-help-stop-ctds" target="_blank"> these instructions </a> may resolve this issue. 

* Controllers may appear above the Unicom frequency and on the map at 0 miles distance, this is caused by the VATSIM feed data baing out of sync and is designed to ensure that controllers are always visible irrespective of the feed. This is normally shortlived and disappears with a refresh about a few minutes when the controller is assigned the correct location. 

* If you are not receiving messages from Vatsim, then the DLL may require additional permissions to run; right click on the DLL and ensure that the unblock security check box, if shown, has been checked . Stop and start vPilot, the reconnect to the network.

â€¢ Some icons do not render correctly in MSFS; this is due to limitations in the MSFS internal browser. This due to the style sheets in the tabulator framework used for the tables; it is on the backlog to resolve (if possible).
