Vatsim Radio (VSR) - MSFS 2020 toolbar app for VATSIM

VATSIM Radio (VSR) is a toolbar app for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 that allows you to check what ATC controllers are online when flying on the VATSIM Network. You can easily change to a frequency with a single click, or place a frequency on standby ready to change when requested to by ATC. 

Information is presented in tabular and map format in a number of sort modes including distance, country, alphanumeric. The app provides easy access to further data including:

•	Station distance & range

•	TAF/METAR (with a free subscription to the relevant service)

•	Textual ATIS information

•	Textual controller informatio

•	Airport information

The app is designed to work in standard and VR views. The package includes a standalone server that ensures that MSFS maintains optimal performance without any noticeable impact on framerates
